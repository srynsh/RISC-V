#### Steps to Compile

> Download the code and name the file `main.cpp`<br>
> Make a file called `input` in the same directory as `main.cpp`<br>
> In the file put the machine code separated by `\n` <br>
> Run `$ g++ main.cpp -std=c++20`<br>
> Run `$ cat input | ./a.out > disassembled.S`<br>
> Now the disassembled code is in a file called `disassembled.S`<br>

#### Note

> I have assumed that the offset is positive for the lables to work correctly. If the offfset is negative then the Label will not be visible.
